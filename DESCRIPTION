Description: Provides functions for the structured processing of PET
    neuroimaging data in preparation for the estimation of Simultaneous
    Confidence Corridors (SCCs) for one-group, two-group, or single
    patient vs group comparisons. The package facilitates PET image
    loading, data restructuring, integration into a Functional Data
    Analysis framework, contour extraction, post-SCC identification of
    significant results, and performance evaluation. It bridges
    established neuroimaging packages (e.g., 'oro.nifti') with novel
    statistical methodologies (i.e., 'ImageSCC') and facilitates
    reproducible analysis pipelines, enabling performance comparison of
    SCC-based analyses with gold-standard methods such as Statistical
    Parametric Mapping (SPM).
