Description: Provides functions for the structured processing of PET neuroimaging data 
    in preparation for the estimation of Simultaneous Confidence Corridors (SCCs) for 
    one-group, two-group, or single patient vs group comparisons. The package facilitates 
    PET image loading, data restructuring, integration into a Functional Data Analysis 
    framework, contour extraction, post-SCC identification of significant results, and 
    performance evaluation. It bridges established neuroimaging packages (e.g., 'oro.nifti') 
    with novel statistical methodologies (i.e., 'ImageSCC') and facilitates reproducible 
    analysis pipelines, enabling performance comparison of SCC-based analyses with 
    gold-standard methods such as Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM).
