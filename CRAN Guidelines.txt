  - [ ] Documentation under 5MB
  - [ ] Data properly compressed
  - [ ] Total package size under 10MB (or explicit justification provided)
- [ ] All dependencies are:
  - [ ] Available from mainstream repositories (CRAN, Bioconductor)
  - [ ] Not orphaned packages (unless in "Suggests" and used conditionally)

## Code Checks and Testing

- [ ] **R CMD check --as-cran** passes with:
  - [ ] NO ERRORs
  - [ ] NO WARNINGs
  - [ ] NO significant NOTEs (or explanations provided in submission comments)
- [ ] Package tested on at least two major R platforms
- [ ] All reverse dependencies checked and still pass their tests
- [ ] Check Windows compatibility using Winbuilder service

## Code Behavior and Security

- [ ] Package does NOT:
  - [ ] Write to user's home directory or system files
  - [ ] Modify the global environment
  - [ ] Terminate R process with `q()` or C/C++ calls like `exit()`
  - [ ] Start external software without explicitly closing it
  - [ ] Send data to external sites without user confirmation
  - [ ] Tamper with other packages' namespaces
  - [ ] Use internal/undocumented functions via `:::` or `.Internal()`
  - [ ] Disable compiler diagnostics or security features

- [ ] Package handles internet resources properly:
  - [ ] Fails gracefully when resources are unavailable
  - [ ] Uses secure downloads (https) for any external resources 
  - [ ] Respects rate limits for web APIs

## Submission Process

- [ ] Use the online [submission form](https://CRAN.R-project.org/submit.html)
- [ ] Submit source tarball created by `R CMD build` (never binaries)
- [ ] No re-submission while a package is pending processing
- [ ] Email confirmation properly handled

## Common Reasons for Rejection

- ERRORs, WARNINGs or significant NOTEs in `R CMD check --as-cran`
- Vague or unhelpful Description field
- Issues with license (non-standard or overly restrictive)
- Writing to user's files without permission
- Usage of internal/undocumented functions from other packages
- Package not portable across platforms
- Examples or tests that take too long to run
- Missing or incomplete documentation
- Namespace issues affecting other packages
- Not responding to web resource unavailability gracefully
