\title{Extract significant SCC points from an SCC comparison object}
\usage{
getPoints(sccResult)
}
\arguments{
\item{sccResult}{A list containing SCC computation results from \code{\link[ImageSCC]{scc.image}}.
       The list should include at least:
\itemize{
  \item \code{Z.band}: Matrix specifying grid positions.
  \item \code{ind.inside.cover}: Indices of grid points inside the confidence band.
  \item \code{scc}: 3D array containing computed SCC values.
}}
}
\value{
A named list:
\itemize{
  \item \code{positivePoints}: Data frame with coordinates where the \strong{first group (Ya) had significantly lower activity than the second (Yb)}.
  \item \code{negativePoints}: Data frame with coordinates where the \strong{first group (Ya) had significantly higher activity than the second (Yb)}.
}
}
\description{
This function identifies and extracts coordinates where significant differences
fall outside the simultaneous confidence corridors (SCCs).
It processes the results from \code{ImageSCC::scc.image()}, returning the extracted coordinates
where the differences are statistically significant.

The interpretation of the results depends on how the SCC was computed.
If SCC was computed as \code{scc.image(Ya = Y_AD, Yb = Y_CN, ...)}, meaning the
\strong{Control group (CN) is the second argument}, the function extracts:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{positivePoints}: Regions where \strong{Control - Pathological} is significantly above SCC.
    These represent \emph{areas where the Pathological group (AD) is hypoactive compared to the Control group}.
  \item \strong{negativePoints}: Regions where \strong{Control - Pathological} is significantly below SCC.
    These represent \emph{areas where the Pathological group (AD) is hyperactive compared to the Control group}.
}

\strong{Make sure to check the order of Ya and Yb in the SCC computation} before interpreting the results.

# Load precomputed SCC example
data("SCCcomp", package = "neuroSCC")

# Extract significant SCC points
significantPoints <- getPoints(SCCcomp)

# Show first extracted points (interpretation depends on SCC computation, see description)
head(significantPoints$positivePoints)  # Regions where Pathological is hypoactive vs. Control
head(significantPoints$negativePoints)  # Regions where Pathological is hyperactive vs. Control
