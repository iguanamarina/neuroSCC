# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of the `neuroSCC` project, pledge to create a harassment-free experience for everyone. We commit to making participation in this project a welcoming and inclusive experience for all, regardless of personal characteristics or background.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that is deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainer at [juanantonio.arias.lopez@usc.es](mailto:juanantonio.arias.lopez@usc.es). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action deemed in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction**: A private, written warning, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

2. **Warning**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

3. **Temporary Ban**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

4. **Permanent Ban**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
