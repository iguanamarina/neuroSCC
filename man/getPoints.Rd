\title{Extract significant SCC points from an SCC comparison object}
\usage{
getPoints(sccResult)
}
\arguments{
\item{sccResult}{A list containing SCC computation results from \code{ImageSCC::scc.image}.
       The list should include at least:
\itemize{
  \item \code{Z.band}: Matrix specifying grid positions.
  \item \code{ind.inside.cover}: Indices of grid points inside the confidence band.
  \item \code{scc}: 3D array containing computed SCC values.
}}
}
\value{
A named list:
\itemize{
  \item \code{positivePoints}: Data frame with coordinates where the first group
        shows significantly higher values than the second.
  \item \code{negativePoints}: Data frame with coordinates where the second group
        shows significantly higher values than the first.
}
}
\description{
This function identifies and extracts coordinates where significant differences
fall outside the simultaneous confidence corridors (SCCs).
It processes the results from \code{ImageSCC::scc.image}, returning the extracted coordinates
where the differences are statistically significant.
}
\details{
- Positive points indicate where the first group (e.g., Control) is significantly stronger.
- Negative points indicate where the second group (e.g., Pathological) is significantly stronger.
- This function must be used **after** running \code{ImageSCC::scc.image}.

\dontrun{
# Load SCC results (previously computed)
load("SCC_COMP.RData")

# Extract significant SCC points
significantPoints <- getPoints(SCC_COMP)

# Display extracted coordinates
head(significantPoints$positivePoints)  # External significant points
head(significantPoints$negativePoints)  # Internal significant points (if any)
