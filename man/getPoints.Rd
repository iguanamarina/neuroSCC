\title{Extract standalone significant SCC points from a SCC comparison object}
\usage{
getPoints(aa)
}
\arguments{
\item{aa}{A list containing SCC comparison results, expected to have elements like \code{Z.band},
\code{ind.inside.cover}, and \code{scc} matrices.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements: coordinates of points with positive differences and coordinates
of points with negative differences. Each element is a matrix where rows are points and
columns represent coordinates.
}
\description{
This function processes an SCC comparison object to identify and extract coordinates of points
where significant differences are detected by the SCC analysis. It returns the coordinates
of positive and negative differences separately, which can be used for further analysis or
visualization on neuroimages.
}
\examples{
points <- getPoints(SCC_COMP_1)

}
