\title{Extract Significant SCC Points from an SCC Comparison Object}
\usage{
getPoints(sccResult)
}
\arguments{
\item{sccResult}{A list of SCC computation results from \code{\link[ImageSCC]{scc.image}}.
       The list must contain:
\itemize{
  \item \code{Z.band}: A matrix specifying grid positions.
  \item \code{ind.inside.cover}: Indices of grid points within the confidence band.
  \item \code{scc}: A 3D array containing the computed SCC values.
}}
}
\value{
A named list with two elements:
\itemize{
  \item \code{positivePoints}: A data frame with coordinates where the \strong{first group (Ya)} shows
        significantly lower activity than the \strong{second group (Yb)}.
  \item \code{negativePoints}: A data frame with coordinates where the \strong{first group (Ya)} shows
        significantly higher activity than the \strong{second group (Yb)}.
}
}
\description{
Identifies and extracts coordinates where differences fall outside the simultaneous confidence corridors (SCCs),
indicating statistically significant regions. This function processes the results from
\code{ImageSCC::scc.image()} and returns the voxel locations that represent either hypo- or hyperactivity.

The interpretation of results depends on the order of input in the SCC computation.
If SCC was computed as \code{scc.image(Ya = Y_AD, Yb = Y_CN, ...)} — i.e., the
\strong{Control group (CN)} is the second argument — then:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{positivePoints}: Regions where \strong{Control - Pathological} is significantly above the SCC.
        These correspond to areas where the Pathological group (AD) is \emph{hypoactive} relative to Controls.
  \item \strong{negativePoints}: Regions where \strong{Control - Pathological} is significantly below the SCC.
        These correspond to areas where the Pathological group (AD) is \emph{hyperactive} relative to Controls.
}

\strong{Always confirm the order of \code{Ya} and \code{Yb} in the SCC computation}
to interpret the directionality correctly.

# Load precomputed SCC example

# Extract significant SCC points
significantPoints <- getPoints(SCCcomp)

# Show extracted points (interpretation depends on SCC setup; see description)
head(significantPoints$positivePoints)  # Pathological hypoactive vs. Control
head(significantPoints$negativePoints)  # Pathological hyperactive vs. Control
